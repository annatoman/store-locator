# Florist Store Locator

## Description

- Using [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API, I created a flower store locator for the Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago, IL using HTML and JavaScript
- To personalize the map further, I created a custom monochrome style in mapbox studio
- This tool allows you to see the flower shops in the neighborhood on the sidebar. When you click the specific florist, it will zoom into the shop location using lat, long coordinates

## Roadmap
- Future releases could include additional flower shops and expand into further areas
- Adding links to the flower shop websites, or access to call them directly using the stored phone numbers
- I would also like to add a custom marker to pinpoint the store locations
